Important lab submission rule. 

1) Labs submitted in wrong section will result in automatic zero unless submitted in right section before the due date. 
2) Labs not submitted in time will result in loss of 25% of your lab grade daily.
3) Please indicate your section (312 or 313) in email subject when discussing lab.
4) Include a screenshot of your error, submission or any other issue on your email for lab discussion. 


There is enough time to work on the lab and submit it, please do not leave it for last minute. 

Good luck, 
Qasim
